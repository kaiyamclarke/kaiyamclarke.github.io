      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I am a Mathematics and Data Science B.S. graduate from Northeastern University 2024. I started off my internship career in finance, interning at Atom Finance (now Toggle AI), Goldman Sachs, and Jane Street. While I assumed finance was my career path I became fascinated with other forms of data specifically in imaging and natural language. I hope to explore these domains and continue to build my skill set as a data scientist as I take on more challenging projects. I am seeking internships in Machine Learning and Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
